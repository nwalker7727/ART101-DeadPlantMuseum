      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p> Here at the Dead Plant Museum, we combine nature with the macabre, as we explore causes of plant death and 
        a large variety of plant diseases. Our founder, Sir Deadplantsalot, found interest in this topic at a young age 
        after accidentally killing a series of succulents in succession. Our mission is to educate the public 
        about ways to prevent untimely plant deaths while also acknoledging the fascinating aspects of the diseases 
        that plague them. We hope you enjoy our exhibits and have a wonderful time.</p>
        that plague them. Additionally, every cent you donate to our charity, "Plant Stop Dying Please I Spent $80 On You At Leaf
        & Vine in Downtown Santa Cruz" will go to a plant in need. 
        We hope you enjoy our exhibits and have a wonderful time.</p>
